## Project Description

The dashboard shown in the image is a sales report for a supermarket shop in 2019. This dashboard includes various metrics that are important to the business, including total sales, total profit, profit percentage, sales by product category, customer type, and payment method.

As a data analyst, I would describe this project in a project description that appeals to recruiters as follows:

"This project involves developing a comprehensive sales dashboard to monitor the business performance of a supermarket in 2019. Using the latest data visualization technology, I successfully designed and implemented an interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into sales trends, profit distribution, and consumer preferences. The dashboard incorporates time-based analysis (year, month, day), consumer demographics (gender), and market segmentation (city category and product type).

Key features of this dashboard include:

Intuitive visualization of monthly and daily sales data, making it easy to understand sales fluctuations.

Sales breakdown by product type, revealing the best-selling product categories and providing insights for sourcing strategies.

Customer type analysis, differentiating between members and non-members, to provide more focused marketing strategies.

Details of payment methods used, which is very useful for optimizing the payment process and customer experience.

These dashboards not only improve data-driven decision-making capabilities but also provide guidance for more effective marketing and product sourcing initiatives. With the analytics I developed, businesses can tailor their offerings to maximize revenue and profits, while ensuring customer satisfaction."
